Downloading the project:

CLone the repository and open the project in Android Studio. I recommend downloading an emulator like Pixel 4 API 30 (R) in order to visualize the build. 
This will reuire around 1.6GB of storage, so make sure that you have enough disk space to download, or use an actual Android device and connect the Device Manager
to it using wifi or USB-C.
Dependencies needed are Lottie, which has already been added to the build.gradle file.
Build the project and then run it; the application will open on it's own and take you directly to the project.
